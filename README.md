# A Pannable and Zoomable Canvas for Android
A custom android view which can be panned across and zoomed in and out of.
___________

## To-Do:
* Prevent user from scrolling past the ends of the canvas.
* Somehow add functionality such that initX and initY snap to the position of whichever finger is lifted first, be it pointer or main (to prevent jumpiness).
* Make sure that the focal point of zoom is accurately determined.
